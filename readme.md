# News App

This project is about News Application and it is prepared by me, Mussie Russom as a persuit follow. This is my first official web page.

The aim of this News app is to give users an up-to date news in different catagories, among others, Business, Entertainment, Health etc....

This app used an external NewsAPI to get all current news. When the app loads, the user will have a catoagory buttons to choose from inorder to display the headline news the user is interested in. If you are interested to read indetail about one news, there will be another button that holds a link to get you the detailed news.

The News App is build using JavaScript, HTML and CSS combined inorder to give the user a pleasant and easy to read news. CSS Grid and flex is applied to organize the content.

Enjoy!
