      Hello, welcome to my web-site. My name is Mussie Russom. I am a junior
      full-stack sofware engineer and a fellow at Pursuit. This is my first
      web-site as a junior software developer. This is a News Website and it is
      intended to give the user current upto-date news headlines around the
      country. The source of the news is from News API, which is news hub for
      current and historic news articles published by over 80,000 worldwide
      sources.
